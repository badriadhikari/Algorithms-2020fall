# Instructions for taking test using Proctrio

## How to setup Proctorio?

If you have not installed Proctorio in Google Chrome, please follow the instructions [here](./supporting_files/Proctorio_Student_Guide.pdf).

## Mac users need to enable screen sharing for browsers 

Apple introduced new security features with the release of OS Catalina. If you are running macOS Catalina - version 10.15 or later - you must grant Google Chrome access to the new screen recording permission in order to share your screen for a proctored session with Proctorio. If you plan to take the test on a MacOS Catalina, you will need to enable screen sharing for browsers. Please read [here](https://support.proctoru.com/hc/en-us/articles/360036574592-MacOS-X-Catalina-Users-Important-Notice) to learn how to do this.

## Instructions  

- You will need to be alone, in a quiet place where you can work uninterrupted. Proctorioâ€™s algorithms will flag excessive noise, conversation, and the presence of others on camera as potential cheating.  
- The camera will need sufficient lighting to monitor your face. Position yourself so that the primary light source is in front of you, preferably illuminating your face. Avoid lights behind your head.  
- A strong internet connection is advisable. Avoid free wifi in public places for this reason. Likewise, you might want to ask roommates or family not to stream video or play games online while you are taking your test.  
- Make sure your laptop is plugged in.  
- Have all study materials put away.  
- You will be required to show your UMSL student ID to the camera at the beginning of the test, so have it handy. If your name and photo in your ID are unclear in the camera, your submission may be cancelled.
- Because of the use of the camera, you should be appropriately dressed.  
- You are required to keep the video on during the entire test time.
- Proctorio will automatically record you video and your screen for the instructor to review.
- You will be required to show a panorama of your room, including your desktop. If you have a desktop computer with a built-in camera (such as an iMac), you can use a mirror to show your entire space.
- You cannot use a smartphone or a tablet to take tests with Proctorio. You must use Google Chrome on a laptop or desktop computer when taking any tests with Proctorio.
