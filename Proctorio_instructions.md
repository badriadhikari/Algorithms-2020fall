# Instructions for taking test using Proctrio

## How to setup Proctorio?

If you have not installed Proctorio in Google Chrome, please follow the instructions [here]().

## Instructions  

- You will need to be alone, in a quiet place where you can work uninterrupted. Proctorioâ€™s algorithms will flag excessive noise, conversation, and the presence of others on camera as potential cheating.  
- The camera will need sufficient lighting to monitor your face. Position yourself so that the primary light source is in front of you, preferably illuminating your face. Avoid lights behind your head.  
- A strong internet connection is advisable. Avoid free wifi in public places for this reason. Likewise, you might want to ask roommates or family not to stream video or play games online while you are taking your test.  
- Make sure your laptop is plugged in.  
- Have all study materials put away.  
- You will be required to show your UMSL student ID to the camera at the beginning of the test, so have it handy.  
- Because of the use of the camera, you should be appropriately dressed.  
- You will be required to show a panorama of your room, including your desktop. If you have a desktop computer with a built-in camera (such as an iMac), you can use a mirror to show your entire space.
