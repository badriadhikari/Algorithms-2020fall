## Question 1
The time complexity of the Dijkstra's algorithm, when the priority queue is implemented using Fibonacci heap, is O(VlgV+E) and that of the Bellman-Ford algorithm is O(VE). These are both single-source shortest path algorithms. One straight-forward technique to obtain all-pair shortest paths is to run one of these two algorithms for every vertex in the graph. This makes the running times O(V<sup>2</sup>lgV+VE)) and O(V<sup>2</sup>E)) respectively. What will be the running times for (a) sparse graph, (b) dense graph, **in terms of E**?

## Question 2
If a dense graph does not have negative weights, is it theoritically equivalent (in terms of speed) to run Dijkstra's algorithm |V| times instead of the Floyd-Warshall algorithm? Why?

## Question 3
Mary wants to solve the single-source shortest path problem on a dense graph with negative weights but she has the Floyd-Warshall all-pair shortest path algorithm implemented already. It is ok (in terms of speed) to use the implementation that she already has?

## Question 4
ToDo: Define L<sup>(m)</sup>. ToDo: Explain the theory that we can calculate L1, L2, etc. one by one to obtain L(n) the solution.
Part I: For Figure 25.1 Calculate L<sup>(5)</sup> from L<sup>(4)</sup> and verify that they are equal.
Part II: Implement the FASTER-SHOW-ALL-...
ToDo: Implement the algorithm:

## Question 5 (programming)
