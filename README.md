## 7. General policies
* Keep yourself out of plagarism; Read [UMSL's Policy](https://www.umsl.edu/services/academic/policy/academic-dishonesty.html); Our `turnitin` tool automatically checks for plagarism; Here is an [example](supporting_files/turn-it-in.png).
* Lecture recordings, audio or video, are not permitted.

## 8. Programming language
* You are recommended (but not required) to use Python3 for all of your homeworks and project. If you have a reason to use a different programming language (for example if your background is in C++ or Java), please send me an email and I can approve you to use a language of your choice.

## 9. Due dates and late policy  
* You can request a maximum two-day extension on any homeworks - for up to two submissions. 
* If you email me a few hours before a deadline and I don't reply you immediately, and if you have not used your two-day extensions, you can assume that the extension is granted automatically.
* Once you use your extension days, late submissions will get no points.

## 10. Oral final exam
The finals for this course will be in the form of a oral test, via Zoom one-on-one meetings. Each meeting may be up to 60 minutes long. Although some oral questions may check your understanding of the concepts, questions on the oral test will mostly focus on the details. Questions in the oral test will be from your own homework submissions. I will randomly pick one of your homework submissions, and ask you some details. Some students who have done exceptionally well may be exempt from the oral test. I will send an email to you if you are exempt, you cannot email and ask to be exempt. Closer to the finals week, you will be able to sign-up to select a time that works for you. Here is an example question:
* In your homework number 3, in paragraph 5, you discuss X and Y. Please mention the purpose of X.

## 11. Attendance
* Attendance will be recorded sometimes.

## 12. Project
* In the semester long-project you are expected to demonstrate an implementation of some practical application of algorithms. You are free to work on "any" project related to any of the algorithms we discuss in class. There are no specific requirements.
* Here is an example project by a student who took this course in Fall 2018 - [MAZE-A-TRON game using BFS](http://umsl.edu/~adhikarib/cs4130-fall2017/student-projects/mazeatron/) [report](http://umsl.edu/~adhikarib/cs4130-fall2017/student-projects/mazeatron-report.pdf)

## 13. Homeworks
* There will be some homeworks from each chapter that we cover. Many of the homeworks will require you to implement algorithms. These programming homeworks carry more weights. Some homeworks will require you to trace an algorithm (in paper) and submit your solution. You can take a picture of your solution and submit in Canvas.

## 14. Grade composition  
* Homeworks (including programming homeworks) = 50 points
* Project = 10 points
* Mid-term oral exam = 10 points (updated on 09/22)
* Final oral exam = 30 points
* 1 bonus point to everyone who complete the course evaluation survey (please email me once you submit the survey)

## 15. Grading scheme  

| Points      | Grade |
| ----------- | ----- |
| 100% to 94% | A     |
| <94% to 90% | A-    |
| <90% to 87% | B+    |
| <87% to 84% | B     |
| <84% to 80% | B-    |
| <80% to 77% | C+    |
| <77% to 74% | C     |
| <74% to 70% | C-    |
| <70% to 67% | D+    |
| <67% to 64% | D     |
| <64% to 61% | D-    |
| <61% to 0%  | F     |

## 16. Resources
Your success in this class is important to me. We will all need accommodations because we all learn differently. If you need official accommodations, you have a right to have these met. If there are aspects of this course that prevent you from learning or exclude you, please let me know as soon as possible. Together we’ll develop strategies to meet both your needs and the requirements of the course. I encourage you to visit the following links to determine how you could improve your learning as well.
